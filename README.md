# BJCP-Guidelines-Parser

BJCP-Guidelines-Parser is a Python-based HTML scraper that extracts data on beer styles from the [BJCP guidelines website](https://www.bjcp.org) and transforms it into a structured JSON format. This tool is designed to help developers and beer enthusiasts quickly access detailed information on different beer styles, including ingredients, characteristics, and brewing techniques.

The [BJCP](https://www.bjcp.org) provides an invaluable resource for beer education and appreciation, and I am grateful for their dedication to promoting high-quality brewing practices and knowledge sharing throughout the beer community.
